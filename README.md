STEPS TO LAUNCH THE WEBSITE:

1. Create a new folder and extract one of the given output folders within, making sure there is a folder named 'src'

2. Copy the directory path of the folder into the terminal (command prompt)

3. Install the following modules by copy-pasting the commands one at at time into the terminal: <br>
	npm install @supabase/supabase-js <br>
	npm install @supabase/supabase-js bcrypt <br>
	npm install bcryptjs <br>
	npm install chart.js <br>
	npm install xlsx <br>
	npm i –save-dev@types/file-saver <br>

If any or one of the modules is not detected, try this method instead: <br>
	npm i –save-dev@types**module name**

4. Launch the website by inputting 'ionic serve' into the terminal. It will immediately open a tab in the browser for you.

** IMPORTANT: Ensure the newly created folder is prepared for ionic projects. If not:

1. Input these into the terminal with the folder directory path, one at at time:
	<br>ionic start
	<br>npm install -g @ionic/cli @capacitor/assets
	<br>npm install

Only then, input: ionic serve
