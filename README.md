STEPS TO LAUNCH THE WEBSITE:

1. Create a new folder and extract one of the given output folders within, making sure there is a folder named 'src'

2. Copy the directory path of the folder into the terminal (command prompt)

3. Install the following modules by copy-pasting the commands one at at time into the terminal:
	npm install @supabase/supabase-js
	npm install @supabase/supabase-js bcrypt
	npm install bcryptjs
	npm install chart.js 
	npm install xlsx

	npm install

Only then, input: ionic serve
